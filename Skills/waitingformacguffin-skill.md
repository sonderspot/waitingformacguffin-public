# WaitingForMacGuffin -- Oscar Market Intelligence

Real-time Oscar prediction market data from [waitingformacguffin.com](https://waitingformacguffin.com). Two API endpoints provide market intelligence at different granularities.

**Base URL**: `https://waitingformacguffin.com`

No authentication required. All data is public and read-only.

---

## Tool 1: Oscar Brief

**When to use**: User asks "What's happening in Oscar markets?", "Any updates?", "Oscar brief", or wants a quick market summary.

**What it returns**: Filtered signals only -- price moves, whale trades ($1K+), frontrunner changes, news sentiment. If markets are quiet, says so (never fabricates activity).

### API Call

```bash
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/brief?hours=24&sensitivity=medium"
```

### Parameters

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `hours` | number | 24 | Lookback period (1-168) |
| `sensitivity` | string | "medium" | "low" (>7pt moves, >$5K trades), "medium" (>3pt, >$1K), "high" (>1pt, >$500) |
| `categories` | string | big 6 | Comma-separated category slugs. Omit for big 6 (best-picture, best-director, best-actor, best-actress, supporting-actor, supporting-actress) |

### Response Structure

```json
{
  "signals": [
    {
      "type": "price_move | whale_trade | frontrunner_change | news_sentiment",
      "category": "best-actor",
      "categoryName": "Best Actor",
      "severity": "major | significant | notable | info",
      "headline": "Chalamet ▼ 5pts to 62c",
      "details": "Best Actor: Chalamet moved from 67c to 62c in the last 24h",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-18T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "market_snapshot": {
    "frontrunners": { "best-picture": { "name": "...", "price": 45 } },
    "whale_trade_count_24h": 7,
    "overall_sentiment": "quiet | active | volatile"
  }
}
```

### How to Present Results

- Lead with the `overall_sentiment` and `whale_trade_count_24h`
- List frontrunners with prices
- Show signals grouped by severity (major first)
- If `signals` is empty, say "Markets are quiet -- no significant moves"
- Use severity icons: major = !!!, significant = !!, notable = !, info = i

### Example

```bash
# Default brief (24h, medium sensitivity, big 6 categories)
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/brief"

# Last 48 hours, high sensitivity, all categories
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/brief?hours=48&sensitivity=high&categories=best-picture,best-director,best-actor,best-actress,supporting-actor,supporting-actress,best-cinematography,best-original-screenplay,best-adapted-screenplay,best-international-feature,best-film-editing,best-costume-design,best-original-song,best-original-score,best-production-design,best-sound,best-documentary-feature,best-makeup-hairstyling,best-visual-effects"
```

## Tool 2: Oscar Research

**When to use**: User asks "Tell me about Chalamet", "Should I bet on X?", "What are the Best Picture odds?", or wants detailed research on a specific nominee or category.

**What it returns**: Deep dive with odds, 7-day trend, precursor wins, whale activity, order book depth + slippage, news, and a data-driven assessment.

### API Call

```bash
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/research?query=Chalamet"
```

### Parameters

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | (required) | Nominee name, film title, or category slug. Supports fuzzy matching. |
| `include_orderbook` | boolean | true | Include order book depth and slippage analysis |
| `budget_for_slippage` | number | 500 | USD amount for slippage calculation (100-100000) |
| `category` | string | (optional) | Category slug to narrow disambiguation |

### Query Resolution

The query is fuzzy-matched automatically:
1. **Category slug or name**: "best-picture" or "Best Picture" returns category overview
2. **Exact name**: "Timothee Chalamet" (case-insensitive)
3. **Substring**: "Chalamet" finds "Timothee Chalamet"
4. **Diacritics-normalized**: "Timothee" matches "Timothee"
5. **Film title**: matches against the film database
6. **Typo correction**: "Chalmet" resolves via Levenshtein (edit distance <= 3)

### Three Response Modes

**1. Nominee deep-dive** (`mode: "nominee"`) -- single match:

```json
{
  "mode": "nominee",
  "nominee": { "name": "Timothee Chalamet", "category": "best-actor", "categoryName": "Best Actor", "ticker": "KXOSCARACTO-26-TIM" },
  "odds": { "current": 62, "impliedProbability": "62%", "trend7d": -5, "trendDirection": "falling", "rank": 1, "categorySize": 9 },
  "precursors": { "wins": ["globe", "cc"], "winCount": 2, "results": [...] },
  "whaleActivity": { "tradeCount": 3, "totalVolumeUsd": 20200, "sentiment": "mixed", "directionRatio": 0.59, "recentTrades": [...] },
  "orderBook": { "bestAsk": 62, "depthAtBest": 847, "slippageAnalysis": [{ "budgetUsd": 500, "avgFillPrice": 62.4, "slippagePct": 0.6, "assessment": "healthy" }] },
  "news": [{ "title": "...", "source": "THR", "sentiment": "negative" }],
  "assessment": { "summary": "...", "edgeIndicator": "strong_value | fair_value | overpriced | uncertain", "risks": [...], "catalysts": [...] }
}
```

**2. Category overview** (`mode: "category"`) -- query is a category:

```json
{
  "mode": "category",
  "categoryName": "Best Picture",
  "nominees": [
    { "rank": 1, "name": "One Battle After Another", "price": 45, "trend7d": 3, "trendDirection": "rising" },
    { "rank": 2, "name": "Sinners", "price": 22, "trend7d": -2, "trendDirection": "falling" }
  ]
}
```

**3. Disambiguation** (`mode: "disambiguation"`) -- multiple matches:

```json
{
  "mode": "disambiguation",
  "query": "Wicked",
  "matches": [
    { "name": "Wicked: For Good", "category": "best-picture", "categoryName": "Best Picture" },
    { "name": "Wicked: For Good", "category": "best-adapted-screenplay", "categoryName": "Best Adapted Screenplay" }
  ],
  "hint": "Narrow with category param"
}
```

When you get disambiguation, ask the user which category they mean, then re-call with `&category=best-picture`.

### How to Present Results

**Nominee deep-dive** -- present in this order:
1. Name, category, and ticker
2. Odds: current price, implied probability, 7d trend (with arrow), rank
3. Precursors: list wins with award names
4. Whale activity: trade count, total volume, directional sentiment
5. Order book: best ask, depth, slippage at the user's budget
6. News: relevant headlines with source and sentiment
7. Assessment: summary, edge indicator, risks and catalysts

**Category overview** -- present as a ranked table with price and trend.

**Disambiguation** -- list the matches and ask user to pick a category.

### Examples

```bash
# Nominee deep-dive
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/research?query=Chalamet"

# Category overview
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/research?query=best-picture"

# With custom slippage budget
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/research?query=Chalamet&budget_for_slippage=2000"

# Narrow disambiguation
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/research?query=Wicked&category=best-picture"

# Skip order book (faster)
curl -s "https://waitingformacguffin.com/api/oscar/research?query=Chalamet&include_orderbook=false"
```

## Available Categories

`best-picture`, `best-director`, `best-actor`, `best-actress`, `supporting-actor`, `supporting-actress`, `best-cinematography`, `best-original-screenplay`, `best-adapted-screenplay`, `best-international-feature`, `best-film-editing`, `best-costume-design`, `best-original-song`, `best-original-score`, `best-production-design`, `best-sound`, `best-documentary-feature`, `best-makeup-hairstyling`, `best-visual-effects`

## Slippage Assessment Scale

| Level | Slippage | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| healthy | <= 1% | Clean fill, safe to size up |
| moderate | 1-3% | Acceptable for most bets |
| thin | 3-7% | Consider splitting into smaller orders |
| dangerous | > 7% | Order book too thin, risk of bad fill |

## Edge Indicator Meanings

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| strong_value | Multiple bullish signals, price may be undervalued |
| fair_value | Signals balanced, price reflects available data |
| overpriced | Risk signals outweigh catalysts |
| uncertain | Mixed or insufficient signals |

## Important Notes

- Odds are in cents (1-99), representing implied probability percentage
- Whale trades are $1,000+ single transactions
- Precursor awards (DGA, SAG, BAFTA, etc.) historically correlate with Oscar outcomes
- Order book data is from Kalshi prediction markets
- Assessment is data-driven and heuristic, not financial advice
